# Bio240_F22

This is the online repository of course materials for Bio240, Biostatistics for Life Scientists.

Here, RStudio opperates in your browser.  Your workspace is unique to you - all of your files will automatically save as you go and you can also save any scripts or files you generate in your online workspace.  You can access RStudio by using the link at the top of the Moodle page.

Important reminders:

When you start working on an R Markdown file, navigate to the appropriate folder in your workspace, click on the "More" button with the gear icon, and select "Set as Working Directory".  This will ensure that all files you generate will be stored in the appropriate place.  You should set your working directory each time you start working on a project.

To generate a PDF file to submit to GradeScope, click on the drop down menu next to the "Knit" button with the yarn icon and select "Knit to PDF".  You will see the PDF appear in the working directory that you set.  You can click on the white box to the left of the file, click on the "More" button with the gear icon, and select "Export" to save the file to your computer.  Upload to GradeScope from there.
